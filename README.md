# 7DaysOfCode_SpotifyML

- ‚ö° This GitHub repository contains code and resources for [Alura's Challenge](https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/machine-learning), a project that analyzes Spotify data and predicts song popularity using Python and Machine Learning. 


- üî≠ The challenge during 7DaysOfCode is to improve my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Machine Learning. The main goal is to analyze Spotify data and apply Machine Learning techniques to predict the popularity of songs. To achieve this, I will go through different stages of a Machine Learning project, including data collection, exploratory analysis, and model validation.

## Bussiness Problem

The topic I am exploring is Hit Song Science (HSS), which is a research field that focuses on predicting the success of songs before they are released in the market. HSS is a sub-area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), which involves gathering information from songs [(ARAUJO, CRISTO AND GIUST, 2020)](https://seer.ufrgs.br/rita/article/view/RITA_VOL27_NR4_108). Pachet and Roy mentioned in their paper [‚ÄúHit Song is Not Yet a Science‚Äù](https://ismir2008.ismir.net/papers/ISMIR2008_133.pdf) that the idea behind HSS is that cultural items, such as songs, have specific technical features that make them preferred by a majority of people. These features can be extracted using algorithms to automate the prediction process for new songs.

The problem I am trying to solve is to predict the popularity of songs and artists. I want to develop data-driven models that can accurately forecast the success of songs and artists on music streaming platforms like Spotify. By leveraging data and insights, I aim to help musicians and record labels make informed decisions about which songs and artists to promote, invest in, and potentially collaborate with. This can help them optimize their marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and increase their chances of success in a highly competitive music industry.
